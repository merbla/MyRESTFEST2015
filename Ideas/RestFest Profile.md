G'day, I'm an Aussie software guy that helps customers work out what parts of "The Cloud" make sense for their business and get those solutions to production.

I am eager to take my basic understanding of REST and Hypermedia to the next level so that I can help my clients build event better apps and services.

|  **Abstract** | There is an every growing list of DevOps tooling and with it comes a growing list of implementations.  Many tools describe infrastructure and environments with data types however orchestrating integration can be difficult.
