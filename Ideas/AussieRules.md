Ideas for 5 in 5

Australian Rules Statistics
--
- A Journey of Statisical Proportions
- Basic Routing
  - `api/player/{id}`
  - `api/game/{year}/{round}/`
  - `api/team/{code}` aka `HAW`
  - `api/team/{code}/players` all players
- Statistics
  - A game is four quarters
  - A game has basic statistics such as
    - Kicks
    - Tackles
    - Goals
    - Marks
  - A game has subjective statistics such as
    - 1%ers
    - Effective Possesions
  - Summary Stats routing can be hard



  ##Proposed Talks
  | Title        | What about DevOps media types           |  
  | :-------------: |-------------|
  |  **Abstract** | There is an every growing list of DevOps tooling and with it comes a growing list of implementations.  Many tools describe infrastructure and environments with data types however orchestrating integration can be difficult.  In this 5 in 5 I want to explore the idea of DevOps media types.  e.g AWS Cloud Formation (JSON), Chef Recipes (Ruby), Azure ARM (JSON), Docker |
