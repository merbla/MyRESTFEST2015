DevOps Media Types
==
There is an every growing list of DevOps tooling and with it comes a growing list of implementations.  Many tools describe infrastructure and environments with data types however orchestrating integration can be difficult.  In this 5 in 5 I want to explore the idea of DevOps media types.

e.g

  - AWS Cloud Formation (JSON)
  - Chef Recipes (Ruby)
  - Azure ARM (JSON)
  - Docker
